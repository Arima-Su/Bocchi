# Bocchi the Bot [Arisu Edition]

A Discord music bot coded entirely on C#. Arisu Edition adds a few unpolished but implemented features that will eventually make it to the Main version.

# Added Features:

- Supports Alice Webhook helper for other external command triggering.

- RconSharp Minecraft server communication for in-game music controls.

- Minecraft server control from Discord. Launch your desired Minecraft server with Discord Commands(*currently in the works*).

# Partnered with:

- Alice v.3.2, a simple Minecraft server UI to make creating and hosting Minecraft servers less intimidating.

- BocchiUI, dislike having to run a console window whenever you want to use the bot? BocchiUI offers a simple UI wrapper that enables hiding the app in system tray and can even be activated on startup with no disturbances.
